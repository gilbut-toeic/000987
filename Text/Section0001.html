  <div class="box_gray5">
    <p class="txtex bl">Purchasers of certain models of cameras manufactured by JCR, Inc. are being alerted to a potential battery issue. Consumer complaints indicate that the batteries of certain models are unable to hold a charge after only being used a few times. According to JCR, the batteries are designed to be recharged a minimum of fifty times before beginning to lose capacity.</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex bl">The affected models are those in the J100 and J200 product lines. Customers who purchased any of these models may exchange the camera’s original battery at any retailer carrying JCR products or by mailing it back to JCR. Details on the exchange process can be found on the company’s Web site. There is no cost to camera owners.</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex bl">Since news of the problem surfaced, sales of JCR cameras have slumped. The company blames the problem on a supplier. “Customer satisfaction is our first priority,” said President Tom Jenkins. “We will do everything to remedy this unfortunate situation, including a redesign of the parts, if needed.”</p>

      <p class="txt dl">I want to let you know that our technician completed his inspection of your Zama 2000 washing machine. He determined that the machine’s motor has died. While we could attempt to repair it, we generally find it is less expensive just to install a brand-new motor. — [1] —</p>

      <p class="txt dl">During the inspection, the technician also noticed that several of the machine’s internal parts were seriously worn and at risk of failure. We could also replace those. Again, you would be responsible for 20% of the cost. — [2] —</p>

In addition, staff will escort children to the rear entrance twice a day at noon and 2:30 P.M. so that parents can pick up their children. Parents arriving after 8:00 A.M. or making a pickup after 2:30 P.M. can still access the building via the main entrance on Washington Boulevard; however, for the sake of your children’s safety, we recommend that you park in our rear lot and walk around the front of the building.

      <p class="txt dl">I just got off the phone with Alcade Promotions. The company has agreed to organize a series of events to promote our newest line of beauty products. Jessica Blackmore, the senior account manager, will plan and coordinate the events. We need to meet with her as soon as possible to start the process. Are you free this Friday at 12:30? I was thinking we could meet for lunch at Winston’s.</p>

      <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="txt dl">We need to prepare some preliminary marketing materials before the meeting. Have Tanya Ivers assemble some of the better product photos we took last month. We should also have a summary of the marketing ideas we generated at our last meeting to present to Ms. Blackmore. Maybe Allison Hogan can work with you to prepare that. Finally, get in touch with Richard Pena. He should be able to provide us with some product samples. I understand that the designs for the jars, tubes, and bottles are not ready yet. However, that should not delay us in getting the actual samples to Ms. Blackmore. We can send her the designs later.</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex dl">Recycling: Bartlett management has enacted a new recycling policy that requires all tenants and their employees to recycle. It is the individual duty of each office to sort trash into recyclables and non-recyclables. — [1] — Bins will be provided as follows: blue bins are for plastic, gray bins are for paper, green bins are for aluminum, and black bins are for regular trash. Detailed illustrated charts will be posted throughout the building to help explain the recycling sorting process.</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex dl">Security: The safety and security of our tenants is our number-one priority at the Bartlett Office Building. The loss of a set of keys to the building’s main entrance last month has raised some concerns. — [2] — Since the missing keys were not found, we replaced the locks on all exterior doors. The new locks require the use of swipe cards. Those tenants who have not picked yours up yet, please do so right away. We also ask that you return your old keys to the security office.</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex dl">Parking Permit: In order to further address security concerns pertaining to our premises, Bartlett management will be issuing parking permits to each office. — [3] — Each person is required to place a permit on the dashboard of his or her car. Cars parked in the building parking lot without a permit will be towed. If you suspect your car has been towed, please call 555-2421. — [4] —</p>

    <p class="txtex">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex bl">As you may have heard, the proposal to rebrand the company was officially approved at yesterday’s board meeting. It was decided that the name change shall be completed as soon as possible. You need to develop a transition plan to ensure that all internal and external communications are ready to be updated. In addition, I would like a team to be formed to create the new company’s logo, which will be unveiled to the public at the same time as the official renaming. I look forward to an initial progress report by next Monday, July 14.</p>

    <p class="txtex dl tcenter">by Veronica Garcia</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txt dl">SEAGRAM (August 12) – As of the last day of this month, Hickox Industrial Manufacturing, Inc. will be no more. The company will announce the official name change to Hickox Technologies during a ceremony at its Seagram headquarters on September 1.</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txt dl">The company’s CEO, Jan Albertson, explained, “The new name better reflects the evolution of our company from a major manufacturer to a diversified technology company.”</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txt dl">Since taking the top leadership position at Hickox three years ago, Mr. Albertson has aggressively acquired smaller, specialized firms with strong growth potential. He targeted software programmers, robotics designers, and research labs to give Hickox a competitive edge in the twenty-first century economy.</p>

    <p class="txts">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txt dl">Hickox was founded in 1955 as a designer and manufacturer of precision industrial equipment. It is currently the third largest employer in Bacon County.</p>

    <p class="txtex bl tcenter">By Mark Swenz</p>

    <p class="txtex">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex bl">Portland, OR (November 18) - Public schools have had to revise their menus to encourage students to eat a more balanced diet. Namely, they have cut down on carbohydrates and refined sugar and replaced them with healthier foods. But have you ever thought about encouraging healthy eating in the workplace?</p>

    <p class="txtex">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex bl">Privately owned catering company Smart Balance says that employees eating a balanced diet are just as important as it is for students, and that’s why it created office-oriented meal plans that include plenty of protein, fruit, and vegetables. Too often, catered food is high in fat and carbohydrates, which can leave employees feeling sluggish.</p>

    <p class="txtex">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex bl">“Tired employees are not as productive as they can be,” said Smart Balance founder Freda Hiens. “In order to have enough energy, employees need to eat a balanced diet.” The cost of more balanced meals is often comparable to standard catered fare as well.</p>

    <p class="txtex">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="txtex bl">Smart Balance, which began in Hiens’ own personal kitchen, received funding from investors that topped $500,000. Today, its regular clients include several local corporations such as Maxmay, Chico’s, and AdWorld.</p>

      <p class="txt dl">Hi, Freda.</p>

      <p class="txtex">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="txt dl">Apple Shoe Box will be having our nineteenth annual holiday party next week for our employees and their family members. We are expecting roughly 2,000 people to attend. We have a few workers who have listed that they prefer not to eat meat, so we would like to request a sample menu featuring meat-free options. When you prepare it, please include four or more appetizers. My partner loves cheese, so it would be great if you prepared one to suit his tastes. Three entrées should be enough. Please include the meatless entrée that you made for the Maxmay event last year. It was delicious!</p>
